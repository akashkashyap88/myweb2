<h2><font color="black"size="20px"  face="arial black">Paris</font></h2>
<P> city and capital of France, situated in the north-central part of the country.
     People were living on the site of the present-day city, located along the Seine River some 233 miles (375 km) 
     upstream from the river’s mouth on the English Channel (La Manche), by about 7600 bce.
      The modern city has spread from the island (the Île de la Cité) and far beyond both banks of the Seine.

   <h3>Character of the city</h3>
<p>For centuries Paris has been one of the world’s most important and attractive cities.
     It is appreciated for the opportunities it offers for business and commerce, for study,
      for culture, and for entertainment; its gastronomy, haute couture, painting, literature,
       and intellectual community especially enjoy an enviable reputation. Its sobriquet “the 
       City of Light” (“la Ville Lumière”), earned during the Enlightenment, remains appropriate,
        for Paris has retained its importance as a centre for education and intellectual pursuits.

Paris’s site at a crossroads of both water and land routes significant not only to France but also
 to Europe has had a continuing influence on its growth. Under Roman administration, in the 1st century bce
 , the original site on the Île de la Cité was designated the capital of the Parisii tribe and territory
 . The Frankish king Clovis I had taken Paris from the Gauls by 494 ce and later made his capital there.
  Under Hugh Capet (ruled 987–996) and the Capetian dynasty the preeminence of Paris was firmly established
  , and Paris became the political and cultural hub as modern France took shape. France has long been a highly
   centralized country, and Paris has come to be identified with a powerful central state, drawing to itself much
    of the talent and vitality of the provinces.

Paris, France
Paris, FranceThe Seine River flows past the Île Saint-Louis in Paris, France.
The three main parts of historical Paris are defined by the Seine.
 At its centre is the Île de la Cité, which is the seat of religious and temporal authority 
 (the word cité connotes the nucleus of the ancient city). The Seine’s Left Bank (Rive Gauche
 ) has traditionally been the seat of intellectual life, and its Right Bank (Rive Droite) contains the heart of the city’
 s economic life, but the distinctions have become blurred in recent decades. The fusion of all these functions at the centre
  of France and, later, at the centre of an empire, resulted in a tremendously vital environment. In this environment, however
  , the emotional and intellectual climate that was created by contending powers often set the stage for great violence in both
   the social and political arenas—the years 1358, 1382, 1588, 1648, 1789, 1830, 1848, and 1871 being notable for such events.</p>
