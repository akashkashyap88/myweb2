    <p1>Everything we see around us constitutes nature, including the sun, the moon, trees, flowers, fruits, human beings,
     birds, animals, etc. In nature, everyone depends on one another to keep the ecosystem healthy. For survival, every creature 
     is interrelated and reliant on one another. Humans, for example, rely on nature for their survival, and nature provides us 
     with oxygen, food, water, shelter, medicines, and clothing, among other things. Many shades may be seen in nature, 
     contributing to the planetâ€™s beauty. Along with humans, animals and birds also find their 
    habitat and means of survival in nature. Therefore, it is essential to take proper care of our nature to maintain a healthy 
    life.</p1>
