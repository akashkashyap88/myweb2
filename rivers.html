Definition of length
There are many factors, such as the identification of the source,
[1] the identification or the definition of the mouth, and the scale of measurement
[2] of the river length between source and mouth, that determine the precise meaning of "river length". As a result, the length measurements of many rivers are only approximations (see also coastline paradox). In particular, there seems to exist disagreement as to whether the Nile
[3] or the Amazon
[4] is the world's longest river. The Nile has traditionally been considered longer, but in 2007 and 2008
 some scientists claimed that the Amazon is longer[5][6][7] by measuring the river plus the adjacent Pará e
 stuary and the longest connecting tidal canal.[8] A peer-reviewed article published 2009 in the International
  <img class="river" img src="images/p2.png">



 Journal of Digital Earth concludes that the Nile is longer.[9]


While this does tie in with the coastline paradox in that the length increases with the resolution of the measure
ment, it does not tend to infinity because a river's length is not a fractal. However, the path along the river's
 deepest point is fractal in the same way that the coastline is.

Even when detailed maps are available, the length measurement is not always clear. A river may have multiple chann
els, or anabranches. The length may depend on whether the center or the edge of the river is measured. It may not be
 clear how to measure the length through a lake or reservoir. Seasonal and annual changes may alter both rivers and 
 lakes. Other factors that can change the length of a river include cycles of erosion and flooding, dams, levees, and 
 channelization. In addition, the length of meanders can change significantly over time due to natural or artificial 
 cutoffs, when a new channel cuts across a narrow strip of land, bypassing a large river bend. For example, due to 18 
 cutoffs created between 1766 and 1885, the length of the Mississippi River from Cairo, Illinois, to New Orleans, Louisiana,
  was reduced by 351 kilometres (218 miles).[10]



These points make it difficult, if not impossible, to get an accurate measurement of the length of a river. The varying
